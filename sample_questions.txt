**You can try asking SiPHY any Ethernet protocol related questions. Here are some ideas:**

**What’s the role of training sequences in 100G Ethernet?**  
**Explain LTSSM state transitions with timing constraints.**  
**Which Ethernet mode (10GBASE-KR vs 10GBASE-R) is better for low-power backplane?**  
**Can I use PCIe Gen4 over retimers for a latency-sensitive accelerator?**  
**Which lane bonding options are valid for PCIe Gen5 x16 in this floorplan?**  
**Can I disable replay buffer if I don’t need retry in SRIOV mode?**  
**Why does my PCIe link get stuck in Recovery.RcvrCfg?**  
**Why are FEC errors spiking under 100G Ethernet load?**
