Try asking SiPHY things like:

1. What is 64b/66b encoding and why is it used in Ethernet?
2. How does Clause 91 RS-FEC help reduce packet drops?
3. What happens during lane deskew in 25GBASE-R?
4. Why not use 8b/10b encoding in 10G Ethernet?
5. Can you do "bump on a wire" design that does not require a Zynq device / micro processor interface?
6. What’s the role of training sequences in 100G Ethernet?
7. Explain LTSSM state transitions with timing constraints.
8. Which Ethernet mode (10GBASE-KR vs 10GBASE-R) is better for low-power backplane?
9. Can I use PCIe Gen4 over retimers for a latency-sensitive accelerator?
10. Which lane bonding options are valid for PCIe Gen5 x16 in this floorplan?
11. Can I disable replay buffer if I don’t need retry in SRIOV mode?
12. Why does my PCIe link get stuck in Recovery.RcvrCfg?
13. Why are FEC errors spiking under 100G Ethernet load?
