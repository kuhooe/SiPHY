**You can try asking SiPHY any ethernet protocol related questions. Below are just some examples to help you get started. **

1. What’s the role of training sequences in 100G Ethernet?
2. Explain LTSSM state transitions with timing constraints.
3. Which Ethernet mode (10GBASE-KR vs 10GBASE-R) is better for low-power backplane?
4. Can I use PCIe Gen4 over retimers for a latency-sensitive accelerator?
5. Which lane bonding options are valid for PCIe Gen5 x16 in this floorplan?
6. Can I disable replay buffer if I don’t need retry in SRIOV mode?
7. Why does my PCIe link get stuck in Recovery.RcvrCfg?
8. Why are FEC errors spiking under 100G Ethernet load?
